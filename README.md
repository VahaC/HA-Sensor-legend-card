# HA-Sensor-legend-card
Custom Lovelace card for Home Assistant that displays sensor values with a fully customizable legend in tooltip.


This custom Home Assistant Lovelace card displays one sensor value and lets you fully customize the legend displayed in tooltip. You can control how sensor is labeled, which icon it uses, and what exactly appears in the tooltip when you hover over or tap on a legend item.

The card is ideal for dashboards where you want a clean, compact view of sensor data but still provide extra context on demand. Tooltips can show units, friendly names, current and previous values, or any computed/templated text you define. This makes it easy to quickly understand what each value means without overloading the main view.

Key features:

Display one Home Assistant sensor in a single card
Customizable legend text for each sensor
Rich, configurable tooltips (units, labels, extra info, etc.)
Optional custom icons 
Designed for compact, readable dashboards
